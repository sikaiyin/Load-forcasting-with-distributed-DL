# load-forcasting-with-DL
The undergraduate thesis on load forcasting model built on spark and tensorflow. There are mainly two parts of this research work:

### 1. Load forecasting via LSTM Neural Network
We built a 2-layer LSTM time-series forecasting nerual network for the power load data.

### 2. Distributed ML models based on TensorFlowOnSpark Architecture
We built a distributed deep learning system by combining the Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop and Distributed TF. The system is based on the architecture of TensorFlowOpSpark by Yahoo.
